Hi! I am an aspiring data scientist who enjoys deriving new insights with data and learning more about data ethics and privacy. I have strong technical skills and an academic background in data visualization, statistics, and machine learning.

I've applied my data science skills as a research assistant at the Department of Political Science and at the Center for Peace and Security Studies. I also earned scholarships to pursue independent research and worked as a Statistical Programming Intern at Acumen recently where I refined my skills with big data. 

I'm graduating in March 2024, and I'm interested in data science, business intelligence, or machine learning internships. Please feel free to get in touch with me via email at gurmankdhaliwal2@gmail.com.
